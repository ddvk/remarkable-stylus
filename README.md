# QT plugin for lamy pen

Generates a key press when the pen button is pressed

# Usage

Copy `libqevdevlamyplugin.so` to `/usr/lib/plugins/generic`

`export QT_QPA_GENERIC_PLUGINS=evdevlamy`  
or `xochitl -plugin evdevlamy` 

to make it permanent edit the `/lib/systemd/system/xochitl.service`

also, you'll need to patch xochitl with `remarkable-hacks` 

## Compilation
```
source /usr/local/oecore-x86_64/environment-setup-cortexa9hf-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi
qmake
make
```


### Automagic
```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddvk/remarkable-stylus/master/patch.sh -O-)" 
```
plus the patch for xochitl from: https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-hacks

### Uninstall Automagic
```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddvk/remarkable-stylus/master/remove.sh -O-)" 
```
plus the patch for xochitl from: https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-hacks

**Needs to be reapplied after a software upgrade (both this and the hacks)**
